# There is still a text box inviting him to add another item. He enters
# "Mow and weedeat the lawn"

# The page updates again, and now shows both items on his list

# Philemon wonders whether the site will remember his list. Then he sees
# that the site has generated a unique URL for him -- there is some explanatory
# text to that effect

# He visits the URL - her to-do list is still there

# Satisfied, he goes back to sleep
